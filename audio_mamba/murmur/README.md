# SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Mamba


## Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation (in PyTorch) of the the paper SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning with Mamba State Space Model. SSAMBA is an advanced audio representation learning model designed to leverage self-supervised learning techniques using the Mamba State Space Model. This project builds on the success of the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) and introduces novel methodologies to further enhance performance and efficiency on various audio tasks. 

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following commands:

Python version: 3.10.13
pytorch Cuda version 11.8 
Torch 2.1.1 

pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118


```bash
cd pre_trained_mamba
git clone https://github.com/SiavashShams/ssamba.git
cd ssamba
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
git clone https://github.com/hustvl/Vim.git
pip install -r /Vim/vim/vim_requirements.txt
```


## Pretraining

We pretrained SSAMBA with various sizes (base, small, tiny) for patches (250, 300, and 400) on a mixture of unlabeled audios from AudioSet and LibriSpeech. You can find these weights in the "Pretrained Model Weights" section below. However, if you want to pretrain the model from scratch, follow this recipe:

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the directory containing the pretraining scripts. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd ssamba/src/pretrain/murmur
    ```

2. **Adjust the Script**: Edit the `run_mask_patch_amba.sh` script to update the paths to your data files:
Change the following paths to the corresponding ones for the server that is running the model:

Run_mask_patch_amba.sh:
tr_data=/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/data/train/circor_train.json
te_data=/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/data/eval/circor_test.json
--label-csv /home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/class_labels_indices.csv 

Run_amba.py:
```bash

sys.path.append('/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/ssamba')
```


Both_models.py: 
```bash
sys.path.append('/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/ssamba/src/Vim')
sys.path.append('/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/ssamba/src/Vim/vim')
sys.path.append('/home/icsl/Documents/adrian/classification/pre_trained_mamba/ssamba/src/Vim/mamba-1p1p1s')
``` 

2a. **Adjust Json files**: Edit the 'audio_mamba/murmur/adjust_json.py' scripte to update the paths to the data files:
Include path to audio_mamba before each of specified paths
```bash
new_directory_path = "/audio_mamba/data/train/"
input_json = '/audio_mamba/data/train/a.json'
output_json = '/audio_mamba/data/train/circor_train.json'

new_directory_path_ev = "/audio_mamba/data/eval/"
input_json_ev = '/audio_mamba/data/eval/a.json'
output_json_ev = '/audio_mamba/data/eval/circor_eval.json'

```

then run the adjust_json.py script 

3. **Run the Script**: After making the necessary adjustments, execute the script to start the pretraining process. You can run the script directly from the terminal with the following command (from path ssamba/src/pretrain/murmur):
    ```bash
    ./run_mask_patch_amba.sh
    ```

## Pretrained Model Weights

## Finetuning
To finetune the pretrained SSAMBA on the balanced earbud recording dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the finetuning directory:**
   - For Audioset:
     ```bash
     cd audio_mamba/murmur/finetune directory
     ```
   

2. **Adjust the paths and hyperparameters:**
   Edit `run_cir_amba.sh` in the audio_mamba/murmur/finetune directory for finetuning on the earbud data. Adjust the paths and hyperparameters as needed for your dataset.
    change the paths for all the following to where the filt, lp, or wav directories (json files for train and eval) as well as the class-labels-indicies directory is for the earbud         data. 
   ```bash
   te_data
   tr_data
   pretrain_path
   conda activate env_name
   label-csv
   ```

4. **Run the job submission script:**
   Execute the `run_cir_amba.sh` script in the terminal to start the finetuning process (if pre-trained model is the tiny size):
   ```bash
   ./run_cir_amba.sh tiny
   ```

   ## Fine Tune the pre-trained tiny model on each of the 3 data sets of (filt, wavs, and lp earbud datasets)
